Most of the things I've worked on are corporate projects, but here are some things I've built recently with my personal time:

# MovieFX3000

A tool for building fake computer screens for use in indie movie projects.

This is also my pet project for testing out new tools and techniques in Rails.

Built with Rails 7, Trailblazer, and React 17.

# EngineNiRad

A collection of open-source Terraform scripts I developed while doing AWS Infrastructure consulting.

# Siphon (Exploratory project)

PaperTrail (the paid service, not the Ruby gem) can get pretty expensive. I'm currently exploring how to replace PaperTrail with AWS Kinesis, S3 and Elasticsearch. Siphon is a Rails application I built to ingest logs from Heroku Logplex to an AWS Kinesis stream.
