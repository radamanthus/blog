I'm Radamanthus Batnag.

Husband and Dad. All-around Rails/React developer.

I'm currently an independent Rails consultant.

I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at two e-commerce startups: [Shogun](https://www.getshogun.com) and [TradeGecko](https://www.tradegecko.com). Prior to this I worked as a DevOps Engineer at [Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com).

I used to be pretty active in the Manila tech scene, and I was the co-organizer of the [Philippine Ruby Users Group](https://meetup.com/ruby-phil) from 2009 to 2012. I still help with community activities from time to time, but nowadays I let the younger generation of developers run the scene.
