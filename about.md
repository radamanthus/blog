I'm Radamanthus Batnag.

Husband and Dad. Rails monk, Devops journeyman, and React novice.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [TradeGecko](https://www.tradegecko.com). Prior to this I worked remotely with [Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com) as devops engineer.

I used to be pretty active in the Manila tech scene, and I was the co-organizer of the [Philippine Ruby Users Group](https://meetup.com/ruby-phil) from 2009 to 2012. I still help with community activities from time to time, but nowadays I let the younger generation of developers run the scene.

Most of the things I've worked on are corporate projects, but here are some things I've built recently with my personal time:

[MovieEffects](https://github.com/radamanthus/MovieEffects)
This is a project I've built (still currently building) to practice my UI and frontend skills. It's built with Semantic UI, React, and Rails 5.

[EngineNiRad](https://github.com/skribgit/EngineNiRad)
Between working for Engine Yard and TradeGecko, I did some AWS Infrastructure consulting. This is an open-source collection of the Terraform scripts I used for those consulting projects.

[Siphon](https://github.com/radamanthus/siphon-rails)
PaperTrail (the paid service, not the Ruby gem) can get pretty expensive. I'm currently exploring how to replace PaperTrail with AWS Kinesis, S3 and Elasticsearch. Siphon is a Rails application I built to ingest logs from Heroku Logplex to an AWS Kinesis stream.
